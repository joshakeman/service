Everything we do will have 2 to 3 levels of layering...

We want to avoid cognitive overload

Minimize abstarctions, layer to bear minimum, 

"Make things easy to understand, not easy to do"

My recommendation is to bind a project to a repo of code.

A project as we define it is bound to single repo of code... I odn't want to feel a project can only manage one binary if it's an application level project ...

The projects taht I have could be managing multiple binaries... cli, admin, data-fetching tools, etc... an entire team coudl work in that repo...

A proejct gets to define a *policy* for the code that's in it
